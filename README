Still needs doing:

Convert cube textures to use a cube map (like the skybox), and pass a texture
name to the constructor

Create a ghost subclass of cube and map it accordingly

Create a room subclass of cube and map it accordingly

Create a dice subclass of cube and map it accordingly
 - When this is clicked, it does some sort of spinning animation and lands with one side up
 - Add some number of ghosts to the scene in a circle around 0,0, outside the room cube
 - Have them always move toward the player camera (spooky)
 - If they touch the player, reset or something
 
 Implement WASD and mouse shooter-like controls


What works now:

Planes and cubes with textures from A6

Everything else from A6

Picking (calls object's wasPicked() method)

Cubes "die" and are removed from the scene when picked
A particle burst animation occurs when a cube is clicked and is removed

^ These two behaviors will need to be moved into the ghost subclass


To build, run ./build.sh in the FinalProject directory.  It will place an executable called "Main" there.
